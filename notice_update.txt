The notice stamped into the bdl is controlled via:
the mapserver config file in here -> layers/annotation/bdl.expiring.layer.map

It is in a special branch, and should only be applied to ogc-test. 


The layer should look something like this:
LAYER
  NAME "notice"                 # we should always have one layer "base"
  METADATA
    "wms_title"     "notice"
  END
  STATUS DEFAULT
  TYPE ANNOTATION

  TRANSFORM ll #set the image origin to be lower left
  FEATURE
    POINTS
      120 -30 #set the offset from lower left position in pixels
    END
    TEXT "Service end of life:!  alaskamapped.org/era" #this is your displaying text
  END
  CLASS
    LABEL #defines the font, colors etc. of the text
      WRAP "!"
      FONT "sc"
      TYPE TRUETYPE
      SIZE 16
      BUFFER 1
      COLOR 0 0 0
      OUTLINECOLOR 255 255 255
      OUTLINEWIDTH 2
      FORCE TRUE
    END
  END
  UNITS PIXELS #sets the units for the feature object
END



To update the notice, checkout the "origin/public_overlay", make changes, then push back to the "origin/public_overlay" branch, then log into ogc-test.x.gina.alaska.edu, and run "sudo chef-client", and it should showup.
